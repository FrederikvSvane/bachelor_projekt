# Weekly dev log

## Week 1 (3. feb to 10. feb)

- Searched for a open source library to handle the solution evaluation. After some discussion and a quick POC in Python, we decided to write it ourselves.

- We chose to write the project in C++, because a CLI program as product, statically compiled cross platform compatible binary and speed are very nice things to have.

- Created docs and setup c++ dev environment, with all the git and cmake bells and wistles

## Week 2 (10. feb to 17. feb )

- Made a webscraper in python to extract publically available data of future court cases in Denmark. In short we now have a bunch of real-world test data for our project.
