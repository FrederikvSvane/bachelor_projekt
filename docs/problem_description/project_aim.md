# Aim of Project

This thesis aims to develop, analyze, and implement efficient algorithms for scheduling court cases, within the Danish judicial system.\
The algorithms will focus on an optimal allocation of judges, courtrooms, and time slots while satisfying a set of operational constraints.\
The algorithms will be analyzed theoretically and empirically verified using real-world data provided by the Danish courts.
