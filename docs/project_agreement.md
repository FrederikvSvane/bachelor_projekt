### Project Description
The topic of this project is algorithms for scheduling problems. The goal is to survey and implement selected state-of-the art algorithms for scheduling problems, and based on the experiences, design and develop new solutions.


### Teaching Goals
•	Survey existing algorithms for scheduling problems.\
•	Implement and compare selected state-of-the art algorithms for scheduling problems.\
•	Design new algorithms based on experiences with existing state-of-the-art algorithms.\
•	Implement a prototype of the new algorithms.\
•	Analyze and evaluate the efficiency of the solutions from a theoretical and practical perspective.\
•	Document key relevant aspects of the work in a concise manner.
